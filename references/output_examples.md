    "prompt": "Answer the given science multiple-choice question. You must provide the separator 'The answer is: ' before your final answer. Your answer must be one of the multiple choice answers: A, B, C, or D. Question: A large gene has dozens of exons, of which the central ones code for folded triple helical repeats that connect the cytoskeleton with sarcolemma and extracellular space. Each exon usually codes for one folded triple alpha helix. The most common mutations of the gene are central exon deletions that create out-of-frame peptides and progressive degenerative organ waste. A solution is to deliver a Morpholino that recognizes the 5' end of the out-of-frame exon in pre-mRNA. The molecule prevents binding of the spliceosome and creates exon skipping and in-frame joining. Several missing exons are well tolerated by an organism. Which structure below is not involved in the proposed therapy?\nA. R-loops\nB. antisense\nC. polyA tail\nD. lariat\n\n",

Welcome to Hawaii, a melting pot of culture, history, and breathtaking landscapes. In this blog post, I'll take you on a virtual tour of my recent trip to the Aloha State, sharing the must-see attractions and cultural experiences that made it an unforgettable adventure.\n\n**Diving Into Hawaiian Culture**\n\nMy journey began on the island of Oahu, where I was greeted by the warm embrace of Hawaiian hospitality. One of the highlights of my trip was attending a traditional luau at the Paradise Cove. As the sun set over the Pacific, I feasted on kalua pig cooked in an underground oven, known as an imu, and sampled poi, a dish made from taro root. The night came alive with hula dancers swaying to the rhythm of the ocean, telling stories of love, nature, and the gods through graceful movements.\n\nA visit to the Polynesian Cultural Center on Oahu's North Shore further deepened my understanding of Hawaiian and Polynesian cultures. I explored six different Polynesian villages, each offering a unique glimpse into the lives of the people from Samoa, Aotearoa (New Zealand), Fiji, Tahiti, and Tonga. From learning to weave coconut leaves to watching thrilling canoe races, the center provided a hands-on experience that left me in awe of the region's rich heritage.\n\n**Must-See Attractions**\n\nNo trip to Hawaii is complete without marveling at its natural wonders. A drive along the Road to Hana on Maui's eastern coast took me through a lush rainforest dotted with waterfalls and past the iconic Rainbow Eucalyptus trees. The journey was as much about the destination as it was about the journey itself, with each twist and turn revealing a new piece of paradise.\n\nAnother must-see attraction is the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park on the Big Island. Witnessing the raw power of Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, was both humbling and exhilarating. The park is a testament to the forces that shaped the Hawaiian Islands, and the opportunity to walk through a lava tube or hike over recent lava flows was an experience I will never forget.\n\n**Cultural Experiences Not to Miss**\n\nTo truly immerse myself in Hawaiian culture, I decided to take a hula lesson at the Waikiki Beachcomber Hotel. Under the guidance of a local instructor, I learned the basics of this ancient dance form, which is not just a dance but a language that tells stories of the past. The experience was not only fun but also gave me a deeper appreciation for the artistry and storytelling in Hawaiian culture.\n\nFor a more intimate cultural experience, I attended a Kawaiaha'o Church service in Honolulu. This historic church played a significant role in the spread of Christianity in Hawaii and is the burial place of many Hawaiian royalty. The service, conducted partly in Hawaiian, was a moving testament to the resilience and strength of Hawaiian traditions in the face of modern changes.\n\n**Closing Thoughts**\n\nHawaii is a destination that captures the heart and soul. From the vibrant Polynesian cultures to the awe-inspiring landscapes, every moment is an opportunity to connect with something greater than oneself. As I boarded my flight back home, I carried with me not just memories, but a piece of the Aloha spirit that I know will stay with me forever.\n\n---\n\nI hope this blog post inspires you to pack your bags and experience the magic of Hawaii for yourself. Aloha, and until next time, keep exploring!\n\n[End of blog post]", "Amidst the gentle strumming of ukuleles, a captivating world unfolded where ancient traditions intertwine with modern marvels, welcoming me to Hawaii, the melting pot of culture, history, and breathtaking landscapes.
